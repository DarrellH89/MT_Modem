 MT †Modem  is a user-friendly, menu driven modem program.  
It operates under both CP/M †and †HDOS.  ç
 MT Modem  many features are discussed in the next section.


  2.  Running MT Modem  

 MT †Modem  †is †run by typing  MTMDM  at the command line.  
The main †menu †will †display †and you're †ready †to modem!  
Choose the Option menu to set the baud rate.  Pick the number †that †
matches your modems or desired baud rate.



- Terminal mode with text capture file (activated by the  f1  key).

- Echo Terminal mode with text capture.

- Conference mode - used on Compuserve or as a Chat mode.
- Receive Files  - Uses XMODEM with Checksum or CRC error checking.  
  The mode is automatically determined based on the sender's capabilities.
- Send Files  - Uses XMODEM with Checksum or CRC error checking.  The mode is 
  automatically determined based on the receiver's capabilities.
- Hang Up - Hangs up the modem by using the DTR line in the RS-232 serial port.
- Even returns you to the operating system when done!


 MT Modem  will send files at 9600 baud in checksum or CRC mode.  
The data throughput will †be higher †with †4 †MHz computers.  In 
checksum mode,  MT Modem will receive at 9600 †baud.  †CRC †error ç
checking †reduces †the †maximum rate to 4800 baud.  H-89's operating 
at 2 MHz are †limited †to †half †the receive rates.

Your †modem †can †be controlled through the MTMDM Terminal mode.  
Most †new †modems †are Hayes †compatible.  †This †means that they 
use the "AT" command set to †control †the †modem †operation.  ç
Please †refer †to †your †modem †manual †for complete †details.  †
Each †modem †supports †the †common †AT commands †in †addition †
to †special commands to control any †non-standard †modem †features.  †
The †mosÙ common †commands †and responses are listed below.  
Each command is followed by †a †RETURN, †except ç
+++.

Command
Response
- Means that modem is alive at well
ATDT1205 244 0192


DIALING
- Command to dial
using Touch Tone.
DP1205 244 0192ä- Escape to command mode
ATH0
- Tell the modem to hang up                                       

The †modem †will †detect †the baud rate you set using MTMDM and 
respond †at †the †same †rate, usually †300, 1200, or 2400 baud.  
After checking that the modem is working with the AT †command, †you ç
will †want †to †dial a number for the Micronics Technology BBS (or 
maybe a local BBS!).  †Use †ATDT †for touch †tone †systems and ATDP 
for rotary phone lines.  Once your modem connects †to †another †modem, ç
the †AT †commands †will †no longer work.  This enables you to send †
and †receive †data †without †worrying about †sending †a modem command.  
When you are ready to disconnect from a system that †doesn't †drop ç
the †carrier, like Compuserve, type "+++".  This will put the modem 
back into the command mode †and you †can hang up with "ATH0".  

The +++ command will not work if the remote system is †sending †data ç

 MT †Modem  †version .8xx users are entitled to one free upgrade.  
The next †version †will †contain Ymodem †protocols, †a †dialing directory, 
and script capability.  Future upgrades will be †$5 †each.  †Please ç
send †me †any †upgrade †suggestions.  Since the code is still being 
written, they †have †a †good †chance †for inclusion.
