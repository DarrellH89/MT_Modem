1.  Introduction


 
Super  Pal  allows  you  to have up to 1.2 Meg of RAM on a single memory  board  in  the  H/Z-100  PC.  
Most  users find that EMS memory is used as a RAM card.  Super Pal provides a RAM disk at a much  reduced 
cost.   The memory is split into 640k of main memory and 640k of RAM disk.  A device  driver,  MTDISK.DVD, 
is supplied to access the RAM disk.  


 
Future versions of Super Pal will allow the use of multiple Zenith memory cards for larger RAM disks.  
The future versions will be completely compatible with the current Super Pal.

 
Super  Pal  is  a programmable array logic (PAL) chip that replaces the Heath  memory  decoder  PAL, 
U455.  Additional memory address signals are decoded from U458 (Port 100h) to provide the ability to address 
all 1.2 meg of memory.  All banks must have 256k RAM chips installed to use Super Pal.


2.  Installing Super Pal

HARDWARE


 
Super  Pal  installation  involves  removing  both  the memory and  CPU  cards.   You  will  replace  the 
memory  decoder  on  the memory card with Super Pal and set the CPU card memory  switches  to  match  the 
amount of memory in your system.


 
a.  If you have a hard disk, run the SHIP program.  An once of prevention is worth a pound of cure  (or 
a new winchester) in case you bump your computer while working on it.


 
b.  Disconnect the power cord.


 
c.  Remove  the  cover.  H-160 owners will have to remove the disk drives and  the  retaining  bar  from 
across the top of the circuit cards. 


 
d.  Remove  the  memory  card.   Minimize your handling of this  card!   Be  especially  careful  of  static 
electricity.   There  are  many  sensitive  components on this card.  BE CAREFUL  not  to  drop  the  mounting 
bracket  retaining  screw  inside  your  machine.   If you do have an accident  with  the  screw,  FIND  it  before 
applying power or continuing with this installation.


 
e.  Find the decoder chip, U455 part number 444-224, (located in the middle of the card) and  carefully 
remove it.  Place in the other side of the packing foam Super Pal was shipped on.  It will not be used again.


 
f.  Find U458, a 74LS174, and remove it.  Set it aside.  It will be installed on the Super Pal PC board.


 
g.   Remove Super Pal PC board from the packing foam and carefully align the mounting pins with  the 
sockets for U455 and U458.  This procedure is best done with the memory card laying on a table.  U455 is a 20 
pin socket and U458 is a 16 pin socket.  The PC board can only be correctly installed one way.  Make sure  that 
the  20  pin  header is correctly aligned with the 20 pin socket.  Also check the alignment of the  16  pin  header 
and  socket.  CAREFULLY press the Super Pal PC Board into the memory card sockets.  Install  the  74LS174 
removed in step f in the 16 pin socket.


 
h.  Make sure that J401 is in the "1st" position.  


 
i.  Install the 256k RAM (150 ns RAM recommended) chips in all five memory banks.  


 
j.  Reinstall the memory card and attach the mounting bracket with the screw removed in step d.


 
k.   Disconnect  the  keyboard  cord  and  speaker wire from the  CPU  card.   Remove  the  CPU  card.  
Minimize  your  handling  of  this  card.  Be especially careful of  static  electricity.   There  are  many  sensitive 
components  on this card.  BE CAREFUL not to drop the retaining screw inside your machine.  If you do  have 
an accident with the screw, FIND it before applying power or continuing with this installation.


 
l.  Set Switch 2-0 through 2-4 for 640k of RAM.  The proper setting is shown in Table 1.

 o4?0 

 
m.   Replace  the  CPU  card  being careful to follow the warnings  in  step  l.   Reattach  the  mounting 
bracket to the computer case.  


 
n.  Plug the keyboard and speaker cables into the CPU card.     


 
o.   Turn the power on and observe the CPU LED's.  At least one floppy disk drive must be  connected 
to the floppy disk controller. All LED's should turn off, one at a time, from the front of the computer.  The last 
LED will remain lit.  


 
p.   Disconnect the power cord and install the cover.  H-160 owners will need to install the  circuit  card 
retaining bar and the disk drives.  Reconnect the power cord and ENJOY the expanded memory of Super Pal.

SOFTWARE


 
The  RAM disk is accessed through the device driver, MTDISK.DVD.  Copy MTDISK.DVD  onto  your 
boot  disk.   Hard  disk owners may wish to copy MTDISK.DVD to their BIN subdirectory.   Add  the  following 
line to your CONFIG.SYS file:

                             device = mtdisk.dvd

3.  Troubleshooting  


 
If  you  have  any  problems, carefully recheck each step of the installation  process.   If  you  still  have 
problems, please call or write us for additional help.  Our hours are 6-8 PM CST M-F and 9-12 Sat.

4.  Operation.  


 
Super Pal provides memory decoding for 640k of main memory.  No additional changes are required to 
use  the  main memory.  MTDISK will create the RAM disk as disk C: on a floppy system or disk G: on  a  hard 
disk  system.  After the boot process, the RAM disk can be used like any other disk on your system.  If you  are 
using  the  RAM disk for data, MAKE sure to copy any new data to a floppy or hard disk before  shutting  your 
system off.  Any data in the RAM disk will be lost when the power is turned off or the system is rebooted.  The 
RAM disk uses no main memory itself.  The MTDISK device driver requires approximately 1k of RAM.


5.  Warranty.  


 
Super  Pal  is  guaranteed  to  work for 90 days after  shipping.   In  all  cases,  Micronics  Technology's 
liability is limited to the cost
