# MT Modem

## Purpose

MT Modem is a terminal emulation program that will support Ymodem transfers (future). The emulated terminal is the Heathkit H-19 which is the same terminal used with the Heathkit H-89 for the early 1980's. MT stands for Micronics Technology, the company I created in 1984 to support the Heathkit community of computers. As part of this project I will finally meet my commitment to support Ymodem for the MT MDM program that I sold for the H-89. The Windows version will connect to serial connection qnd provide both terminal emulation and file transfers.
